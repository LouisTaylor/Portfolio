        <h4>
            Work Experience
        </h4>
        <p>
            I worked at Shaw's, and Shoprite when Shaw's was purchased, of Enfield for two years while I obtained my bachelor's degree.
            Once I graduated, I immediately found a job at the local Probate Court in town where I quickly rose to become Chief Clerk. I have been at the Court for a total of twelve years where I oversee Court function and person.
